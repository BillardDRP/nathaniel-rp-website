<h2>Welcome to NathanielRP!</h2>
<p>NathanielRP is a friendly server that runs DarkRP. We are currently working on running a successful and fun server with active players and nice admins.</p>

<h2>Current Staff</h2>
<p>Our current staff consists of our owner, Nathaniel, our coder, Sir Francis Billard, a few admins, and many moderators.</p>

<h2>Server Rules</h2>
<p>1.Complaining that somebody broke NLR, RDM, fear RP or not adverting a raid/mug/terror will get you kicked, and even banned after multiple offenses.<br>2. Do not kill mass amounts of people for no reason.<br>3. For fun's sake, NLR just doesn't apply at any time or any place in NathanielRP.<br>4. Advertising things such as raids, mugs, or terrorist attacks are not mandatory at all.</p>
